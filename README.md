## Upgrading (For old installations)
*In case of issues, feel free to contact the developers*.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### Upgrading from v6 to new installer

#### Recommended: Fresh install
* Download the [new version](https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and run the start_tts_webui.bat (Windows) or start_tts_webui.sh (MacOS, Linux)
* Once it is finished, close the server.
* Recommended: Copy the old generations to the new directory, such as favorites/ outputs/ outputs-rvc/ models/ collections/ config.json
* With caution: you can copy the whole new tts-generation-webui directory over the old one, but there might be some old files that are lost.

#### In-place upgrade, can delete some files, tweaks
* Update the existing installation using the update_*platform* script
* After the update run the new start_tts_webui.bat (Windows) or start_tts_webui.sh (MacOS, Linux) inside of the tts-generation-webui directory
* Once the server starts, check if it works.
* With caution: if the new server works, within the one-click-installers directory, delete the old installer_files.

#### *Is there any more optimal way to do this?*

Not exactly, the dependencies clash, especially between conda and python (and dependencies are already in a critical state, moving them to conda is ways off). Therefore, while it might be possible to just replace the old installer with the new one and running the update, the problems are unpredictable and **unfixable**. Making an update to installer requires a lot of testing so it's not done lightly.

</details>

## Installation
* Download the [latest version](https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.
* Run start_tts_webui.bat or start_tts_webui.sh to start the server. It will ask you to select the GPU/Chip you are using. Once everything has installed, it will start the Gradio server at http://localhost:7770 and the React UI at http://localhost:3000.
* Output log will be available in the installer_scripts/output.log file.
* Note: The start script sets up a conda environment and a python virtual environment. Thus you don't need to make a venv before that, and in fact, launching from another venv might break this script.

### Manual installation (not recommended)

For detailed manual installation instructions, please refer to the [Manual Installation Guide](./documentation/manual_installation.md).

### Docker Setup

tts-generation-webui can also be ran inside of a Docker container. Using CUDA inside of docker requires (NVIDIA Container Toolkit)[https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html]. To get started, pull the image from GitHub Container Registry:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui:main
```

Once the image has been pulled it can be started with Docker Compose:
The ports are 7770 (env:TTS_PORT) for the Gradio backend and 3000 (env:UI_PORT) for the React front end.

```
docker compose up -d
```

The container will take some time to generate the first output while models are downloaded in the background. The status of this download can be verified by checking the container logs:

```
docker logs tts-generation-webui
```

#### Building the image yourself
If you wish to build your own docker container, you can use the included Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t tts-generation-webui .
```
Please note that the docker-compose needs to be edited to use the image you just built.


## Compatibility / Errors

Audiocraft is currently only compatible with Linux and Windows. MacOS support still has not arrived, although it might be possible to install manually.

### Torch being reinstalled

Due to the python package manager (pip) limitations, torch can get reinstalled several times. This is a wide ranging issue of pip and torch.

### Red messages in console
These messages:
```
---- requires ----, but you have ---- which is incompatible.
```
Are completely normal. It's both a limitation of pip and because this Web UI combines a lot of different AI projects together. Since the projects are not always compatible with each other, they will complain about the other projects being installed. This is normal and expected. And in the end, despite the warnings/errors the projects will work together.
It's not clear if this situation will ever be resolvable, but that is the hope.
