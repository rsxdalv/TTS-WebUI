## July 2024

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

July 31:
* Fix React UI's MusicGen after the Gradio changes.
* Add unload button to Whisper extension.

July 29:
* Change FFMpeg to 4.4.2 from conda-forge in order to support more platforms, including Mac M1.

* Whisper extension
* Experimental AMD ROCM install support. (Linux only)

* Convert Simple Remixer to extension
* Fix update.py to use the newer torch versions (update.py is only for legacy purposes and will likely break)
* Add Diagnostic script and Force Reinstall scripts for Windows.

July 20:
* Fix Discord join link
* Simplify Bark further, removing excessive complexity in code.
* Add UI/Modular extensions, these extensions allow installing new models and features to the UI. In the future, models will start as extensions before being added permamently.
* Disable Gallery view in outputs
* Known issue: Firefox fails at showing outputs in Gradio, it fails at fetching them from backend. Within React UI this works fine.

July 15:
* Comment - As the React UI has been out for a long time now, Gradio UI is going to have the role of serving only the functions to the user, without the extremely complicated UI that it cannot handle. There is a real shortage of development time to add new models and features, but the old style of integration was not viable. As the new APIs and 'the role of the model' is defined, it will be possible to have extensions for entire models, enabling a lot more flexibility and lighter installations.
* Start scaling back Gradio UI complexity - removed _send to RVC/Demucs/Voice_ buttons. (Remove internal component Joutai).
* Add version.json for better updates in the future.
* Reduce Gradio Bark maximum number of outputs to 1.
* Add unload model button to Tortoise, also unload the model before loading the next one/changing parameters, thus tortoise no longer uses 2x model memory during the settings change.

July 14:
* Regroup Gradio tabs into groups - Text to Speech, Audio Conversion, Music Generation, Outputs and Settings
* Clean up the header, add link for feedback
* Add seed control to Stable Audio

## Upgrading (For old installations)
*In case of issues, feel free to contact the developers*.

### Upgrading from v6 to new installer

#### Recommended: Fresh install
* Download the [new version](https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and run the start_tts_webui.bat (Windows) or start_tts_webui.sh (MacOS, Linux)
* Once it is finished, close the server.
* Recommended: Copy the old generations to the new directory, such as favorites/ outputs/ outputs-rvc/ models/ collections/ config.json
* With caution: you can copy the whole new tts-generation-webui directory over the old one, but there might be some old files that are lost.

#### In-place upgrade, can delete some files, tweaks
* Update the existing installation using the update_*platform* script
* After the update run the new start_tts_webui.bat (Windows) or start_tts_webui.sh (MacOS, Linux) inside of the tts-generation-webui directory
* Once the server starts, check if it works.
* With caution: if the new server works, within the one-click-installers directory, delete the old installer_files.

#### *Is there any more optimal way to do this?*

Not exactly, the dependencies clash, especially between conda and python (and dependencies are already in a critical state, moving them to conda is ways off). Therefore, while it might be possible to just replace the old installer with the new one and running the update, the problems are unpredictable and **unfixable**. Making an update to installer requires a lot of testing so it's not done lightly.

</details>

## Installation
* Download the [latest version](https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.
* Run start_tts_webui.bat or start_tts_webui.sh to start the server. It will ask you to select the GPU/Chip you are using. Once everything has installed, it will start the Gradio server at http://localhost:7770 and the React UI at http://localhost:3000.
* Output log will be available in the installer_scripts/output.log file.
* Note: The start script sets up a conda environment and a python virtual environment. Thus you don't need to make a venv before that, and in fact, launching from another venv might break this script.

### Manual installation (not recommended)
* These instructions might not reflect all of the latest fixes and adjustments, but could be useful as a reference for debugging or understanding what the installer does. Hopefully they can be a basis for supporting new platforms, such as AMD/Intel.

* Install conda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
  * (Windows) Install Visual Studio compiler / Visual Studio Build Tools https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

* Run react: `npm start`
* Also run the python server: `python server.py` or with `start_tts_webui` script

### Docker Setup

tts-generation-webui can also be ran inside of a Docker container. Using CUDA inside of docker requires (NVIDIA Container Toolkit)[https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html]. To get started, pull the image from GitHub Container Registry:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui:main
```

Once the image has been pulled it can be started with Docker Compose:
The ports are 7770 (env:TTS_PORT) for the Gradio backend and 3000 (env:UI_PORT) for the React front end.

```
docker compose up -d
```

The container will take some time to generate the first output while models are downloaded in the background. The status of this download can be verified by checking the container logs:

```
docker logs tts-generation-webui
```

#### Building the image yourself
If you wish to build your own docker container, you can use the included Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t tts-generation-webui .
```
Please note that the docker-compose needs to be edited to use the image you just built.

### Codebase and Dependencies

The codebase is licensed under MIT. However, it's important to note that when installing the dependencies, you will also be subject to their respective licenses. Although most of these licenses are permissive, there may be some that are not. Therefore, it's essential to understand that the permissive license only applies to the codebase itself, not the entire project.

That being said, the goal is to maintain MIT compatibility throughout the project. If you come across a dependency that is not compatible with the MIT license, please feel free to open an issue and bring it to our attention.

Known non-permissive dependencies:
| Library     | License           | Notes                                                                                     |

### Model Weights
Model weights have different licenses, please pay attention to the license of the model you are using.

Most notably:
- Bark: MIT
- Tortoise: *Unknown* (Apache-2.0 according to repo, but no license file in HuggingFace)
- MusicGen: CC BY-NC 4.0
- AudioGen: CC BY-NC 4.0


## Compatibility / Errors

Audiocraft is currently only compatible with Linux and Windows. MacOS support still has not arrived, although it might be possible to install manually.

### Torch being reinstalled

Due to the python package manager (pip) limitations, torch can get reinstalled several times. This is a wide ranging issue of pip and torch.

### Red messages in console
These messages:
```
---- requires ----, but you have ---- which is incompatible.
```
Are completely normal. It's both a limitation of pip and because this Web UI combines a lot of different AI projects together. Since the projects are not always compatible with each other, they will complain about the other projects being installed. This is normal and expected. And in the end, despite the warnings/errors the projects will work together.
It's not clear if this situation will ever be resolvable, but that is the hope.
